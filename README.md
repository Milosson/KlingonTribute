## Media and Credits / Acknowledgements

This project was inspired originally from the TV series - Big Bang Theory, which I believe was the first edition of this game ever presented. 

When it was time to start planning my second project for school including HTML, CSS and JavaScript the choice to make this game was just an easy call. 

With the help and inspiration of others throughout Stackoverflow and other sources such as YouTube and CodeInstitutes (my current school), I developed my own way of creating this beloved game with a touch of humor included as i translated the game description into Klingon. I feel like I've created my own version as I wanted it.

Special thanks and recognition to: 
 * My awesome mentor **Gareth McGirr** [GitHub](https://github.com/Gareth-McGirr), His project and the way I choose to create i.e object map was inspired through his project mainly through his source [TheSoftwareDude](https://www.thatsoftwaredude.com/content/6196/coding-a-card-deck-in-javascript). This was combined all together with above mentioned sources.

### Gratitude
