## Future features 

 #### Moving forward, I aim to make following adjustments:
- Transition from using onclick functions in game.html to eventListeners in script.js.
- Implement media queries to ensure a seamless mobile-first experience, particularly addressing compability issues within the 280px - 425px range. This is crucial, as the current flex properties may encounter challenges on a variety of devices within this range.
- Incorporate sound effects triggered upon activation of the onclick events to provide immersive user experience during gameplay.
- Re-structure the buttons for smaller devices, adding JS function to dynamically remove certain elements, optimizing the layout for smaller devices.
- Reviewing the color-scheme to optimize the best user experience and meet the requirements for a higher LightHouse score.

#### Lighthouse Report
 * Lighthouse report generated an overall awesome result, with accessibility scoring the lowest at 89, The reason for this is the insufficient contrast between the scoreboard, buttons, etc., and the background-color.

## Media and Credits / Acknowledgements

This project was inspired originally from the TV series - Big Bang Theory, which I believe was the first edition of this game ever presented. 

When it was time to start planning my second project for school including HTML, CSS and JavaScript the choice to make this game was just an easy call. (Also one of the suggestions from school as a first project in JavaScript).

With the help and inspiration of others throughout Stackoverflow and other sources such as YouTube and CodeInstitutes (my current school), I developed my own way of creating this beloved game with a touch of humor included as i translated the game description into Klingon. I feel like I've created my own version as I wanted it.

### Code
 - Object mapping and general code was inspired and used from [Coding Therapy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT1pwM7hRtQ&ab_channel=CodingTherapy)
 - Inspired and code snippets used from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yS-JV4fWqY&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified)

 ### Klingon translated welcome text / game description
 - [Translater](https://www.translator.eu/english/klingon/translation/) Used various translation websites to translate the welcome text. Conclusively, results varied across different platforms, and when reverting the translated text back to its original English form, the outcome were distinctly different. 
 Let's just hope the inhabitants of Qo'noS won't take offense and interpret this genuine attempt to earn universal respect and understanding! ðŸ––


### Special thanks and recognition to: 
 * My awesome mentor **Gareth McGirr** [GitHub](https://github.com/Gareth-McGirr), His project and the way I choose to create i.e object map was inspired through his project mainly through his source [TheSoftwareDude](https://www.thatsoftwaredude.com/content/6196/coding-a-card-deck-in-javascript). This was combined all together with above mentioned sources.

### Gratitude
### *A heartfelt shout-out to my mentor, [Gareth McGirr](https://github.com/Gareth-McGirr), and my school, [CodeInsitute](https://codeinstitute.net/), for providig me with the knowledge to bring this project to life. Their tutorials have been a key factor in shaping this project, and I am grateful for their support.*
